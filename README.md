# Modular Insurance ETL Pipeline

A custom-built, production-ready ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process messy CSV data, validate it against strict business rules, and safely load it into a MySQL database. 

I built this project to bridge the gap between basic scripting and industry-standard software engineering. Instead of just writing a script that "works," I focused on making a system that fails gracefully, logs its actions, and protects the database from bad data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Libraries:** `mysql-connector-python` (Database driver), `python-dotenv` (Environment variable management)
* **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Singleton Pattern, Context Managers

## 💡 Key Engineering Decisions

Here is a breakdown of why I structured the code the way I did:

* **Zero `print()` Statements:** The system uses Python's `logging` module exclusively. Every event, warning, and critical failure is time-stamped and written to an `etl_process.log` file. 
* **Object-Oriented Validation:** Data rules (like checking for negative premium amounts or empty policy IDs) are separated into individual classes using inheritance. If a row fails, the pipeline logs a warning and skips the row without crashing the entire system.
* **Safe Database Connections:** I used a Python Context Manager (`__enter__` and `__exit__`) for the MySQL connection. If the program crashes halfway through reading a file, the context manager guarantees the database connection is closed and any partial, corrupted inserts are rolled back.
* **Staging to Master Architecture:** The SQL script (`report.sql`) doesn't just dump data. It loads data into a raw `staging` table first, uses `INSERT IGNORE` to safely move unique records to a `master` table, and then truncates staging. This makes the pipeline idempotent (you can run it 100 times without duplicating data).
* **Advanced SQL:** Included a reporting view utilizing Window Functions (`DENSE_RANK()`) to analyze regional claim data.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
`git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-etl-pipeline.git](https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-etl-pipeline.git)
cd insurance-etl-pipeline`

2. Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Set up your environment variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your MySQL credentials:

4. Add data
Place any messy insurance data CSV files into the data/incoming/ folder.

5. Run the pipeline
`python main.py`
